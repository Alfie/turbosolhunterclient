This is the page for the turbo client of the SolHunter game there are a few bugs, 
- you need to use the ts client https://solhunterreduxclient.vercel.app/ to move and spawn.
- The page needs to be closed and reopened for every interaction. however changes are displayed almost immediately on the turbo client (https://turbosolhunterclient.vercel.app/) version

This is the anchor smart contract https://github.com/Alfie/solhunterredux
